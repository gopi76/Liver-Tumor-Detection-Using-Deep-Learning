Capstone Project Viva Preparation - Gopi Krishna [ 23/05/2024 - 10.25pm ]

1. collected the dataset from kaggle. 755 liver tumor images and 755 mask images [ image dimension 512*512]

2. data preprocessing : preprocess the collected data using various techniques resizing, scaling and normalization

3. Algrothm: define and train a CNN Model (10 layers used )

Why Only CNN why not other algorithms ? 

CNN plays a crucial role in various image based tasks like object detection, image segmentation. Apart from that it can learn complex

data features from the images and it can provide accurate insights and predictions.

advantages : better results for image based tasks.

disadvanatges : time-consuming

challenges :  requried lots of data and required expertise to use CNN architecture

Working of CNN: 
1. input layer: it takes the input from raw data

2. hidden layer: this is the place where all computation will be done (hidden). this is the intermediate layer between input and output layer

3. output layer: this layer produces the output based on input data.

Activation function : Used to add some non.linearity to the neural networks.

For our porject we used only 2 actviation functions:

a) Relu [ Rectified Linear Unit ]: 
    1. common activiation function and used for many neural networks.
    2. Faster than signmoid and tanh activation functions
    3. range : 0 to + infinity
    4.it prevents the gradient vanishing problems

b) Sigmoid function : range: 0 to +1 
    1. s- shaped curve
    2. used only for the binay classification. [ softmax used for mutliclassifiation tasks and range is 0 to +1 ].

Dice coefficient:  Calculates the Dice coefficient, a measure of overlap between the predicted and true binary segmentation masks.

training : 80 %, testing : 20 %

if tumor detection >= 50, then it is stage 3.  [ advanced stage ]
if tumor detection >30 and < 50 , then it is stage 2  [  inteermediate stage ]
if tumor detection <= 30, then it is stage 1   [ early stage ] 

if not detected, shows no tumor detected.

Optimizer used: Adam optimizer is a popular optimization algorithm used in training deep learning models. 
Adam stands for Adaptive Moment Estimation, and it combines the advantages of two other extensions of stochastic gradient descent: AdaGrad and RMSProp. 
It computes adaptive learning rates for each parameter.

Django : created a web user frindly interface where user can conviently upload the images of liver scans and get the results.

[ prepare django questions, i dont have a idea about it ]


sql : those said contributing as sql they done, remember commands, sql vs mysql, rdbms

definitions of machine learning, ai, deep learning:

remeber deep learning is subset of machine learning
machine learning is a subset of AI.

cnn is advanced machine learning algorithms and it comes under supervised (deep learning)

types of deep learning: supervised [ cnn, rnn, MLP ], unsupervised, [autoencoders, GANs], other hybrid models.

applications of deep learning : self driving cars, voice assitants like siri or alexa, snapchat filters

applications of machine learning : email spam detection, credit card fraud detection, house pricing prediction, etc.


STEPS :
data collection, data preprocessing, model training and model buliding, model testing, model deployment
